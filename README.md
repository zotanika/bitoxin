BITOXIN module
==============

This kernel module contains codes conducting an experimental algorithm designed for accelerating _any unknown system(both software and hardware) vulnerabilities_ to be exposed as soon as possible in stochastic manner.
The [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thinking-algorithm-accelerating-yet-unknown-system-exposed-%EC%84%A0%EC%B2%A0-%EC%A0%95/) describes the initialtives and basic idea where this algorithm is based on.
Note that this draft implementation is only focusing to test robustness of CPU(aarch64)/RAM/memory management/etc for now.
